# Collect Resources & Build Prototype (Unreal Engine â€“ C++ & Blueprints)

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project, developed as **Artifact 3**, is a prototype built in **Unreal Engine 5** that demonstrates a survival-style resource collection and building system.  
The main focus of the prototype is combining **C++ code** with **Blueprints** to create gameplay mechanics such as resource gathering, AI behavior, player stats, and UI systems.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- **Player Character (C++ & Blueprint):**  
  First-person setup with camera controls, basic movement, and stat management (health, hunger, stamina).  

- **Resource System:**  
  Collect resources (e.g., wood, stone, berries) with amounts tracked in C++.  
  Resources display their type and amount using world text.  

- **Crafting & Building:**  
  Use gathered resources to place simple building parts such as walls.  
  Code handles building meshes, pivot points, and placement logic.  

- **AI System (Blueprint):**  
  Basic wandering AI implemented with an **AI Controller** and NavMesh.  

- **UI System:**  
  HUD elements update player stats in real-time.  
  Win/Lose widget screens with retry/quit buttons.
